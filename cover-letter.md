Four Kitchens Recruiting Department

Dear Hiring Manager(s),

Four Kitchens has been a company I've been following for a long time as a Drupal Developer, for all of its expertise spread through its many contributions to the Drupal community over the years.

To me it's cause for joy to be applying for a position with you, knowing that if I get hired, I'll be surrounded by the best, in such an environment where I'll have the potential to take my Drupal and web dev skills a whole step above.

That's something I'll thrive for!

## Core Values

Among your six core values, I would like to highlight two I identify myself with the most:

### Give Back

Having realised at a young age that life is short, and that there's something more to it than just "carpe diem", I thrive to leave a good legacy on this earth. I do that through serving on my local church as a speaker (teaching our beliefs and being a moderator on our study groups) and volunteering on my local community through different activities (like giving coding classes to the young).

Here's a picture of myself and my good friend Galileu, who's an intern in a nursing home in my home town that I visit every single weekend.

(*Galileu got blinded by diabetes, so I like to play him some traditional Brazilian folk music to help him relive some memories from his past*).

The work at church also serves as a tool that keeps me pushing towards polishing my **communication** skills!

### Always Improve

I'm hungry for knowledge by DNA and deeply believe we're all blessed to live in the age of the internet where information is free and accessible to the great majority of people.

I've thought myself how to play about five different instruments, not to say about how easy I can learn new technologies when that's all I've been doing at work for the past 16 years.

### Work Experience

I've started my career as a software developer in 2005, on a company that had a software for the financial industry written in PHP + MySQL. I was taught "code poetry" right from the beginning through OOP, coding standards, best practices, design patterns etc.

From there I've had the chance to work with other (web) software development companies, until  2009 when I joined an agency called "Zee" and met Drupal to never part ways with ever since.

Event though the first days of Drupal got me focused on website creation, the aspect of it that always fascinated me was the ability the use it a software platform, leveraging my knowledge from the early days to create powerful solutions without having to reinvent the wheel.

All this potential reached it's peak at the time I worked for "Estude Matemática", where I had the chance to structure and build an LMS on top of Drupal 8 that used Emulsify for the most part of the front-end, exception made for the checkout page which was a hybrid/progressively decoupled app built using React.

Not to mention all the freelancing through these years, almost two years ago I started working as a Full Time Employee at Taoti Creative, a Washington DC based digital agency, where I've been working on creating dynamic websites for big companies.

The last project I built (and was the team's tech lead) was [https://reit.com](https://reit.com). That was a D7 to D8 rebuild with many technical challenges.

Here's a short list of some the cool stuff I did:

- Content migration of over 1000 pages of different types, having complex data structures using the Migrate API
- API Integrations to import financial data for REIT companies and investment funds from services like FactSet and Morningstar
- Custom module development to implement all sorts of custom functionality, from which I would like to highlight a Google Sheets integration that I've proposed and implemented to replace their old tax forms system, which was based on spreadsheet files being passed around via email. This integration uses CRON jobs to check for updates on these Google Sheets documents, grabbing the important data and feeding it into Drupal, as well as sending the appropriate emails on status updates.

Being an enthusiast of the english language, I'm someone who's constantly working on improving my speaking, writing and listening skills, as well as my accent.

I would welcome the chance to further discuss your objectives for this position and give you the chance to get to know me better as well.

With best regards,

Heitor Althmann Cezar.
